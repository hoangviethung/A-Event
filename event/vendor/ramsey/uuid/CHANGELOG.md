# ramsey/uuid Changelog

<<<<<<< HEAD
## 3.8.0

_Released: 2018-07-19_

  * Add support for determining MAC address on FreeBSD systems ([#212](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/212))
  * Add a polyfill for PHP ctype functions to support systems where the ctype functions are not part of the PHP build ([#223](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/223))
  * Improve validation to disallow UUIDs with a trailing newline character ([#225](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/225))
  * Add annotations for thrown exceptions for improved IDE hinting ([#232](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/232))
  * Improve documentation, testing, and project metadata (i.e. `.gitattributes`, etc.)

## 3.7.3

_Released: 2018-01-19_

  * In rare cases, when using `glob()` to find `/sys/class/net/*/address` files on Linux, `glob()` encountered errors, returning `false` instead of an empty array, causing `array_map()` to emit warnings since its second parameter was not an array; this release gracefully handles cases where `glob()` returns `false` [#203](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/issues/203)
  * Fixed an off-by-one error in `DefaultTimeGenerator` and switching to `random_int()` from `mt_rand()` for better random numbers [#206](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/206)

## 3.7.2

_Released: 2018-01-13_

  * On Linux, first check sysfs to determine node identifier; this provides a reliable way to identify the node on Docker images, etc. [#185](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/185)

## 3.7.1

_Released: 2017-09-22_

  * Use `random_bytes()` when generating random nodes
  * Set the multicast bit for random nodes, according to RFC 4122, ยง4.5, [#170](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/170), [#171](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/171), [#182](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid/pull/182)

## 3.7.0

_Released: 2017-08-04_

## [Unreleased]

### Added

### Changed

### Deprecated

### Removed

### Fixed

### Security


## [3.9.1] - 2019-12-01

### Fixed

* Fix `RandomNodeProvider` behavior on 32-bit systems. The `RandomNodeProvider`
  was converting a 6-byte string to a a decimal number, which is a 48-bit,
  unsigned integer. This caused problems on 32-bit systems and has now been
  resolved.


## [3.9.0] - 2019-11-30

### Added

* Add function API as convenience. The functions are available in the
  `Ramsey\Uuid` namespace.
  * `v1(int|string|null $node = null, int|null $clockSeq = null): string`
  * `v3(string|UuidInterface $ns, string $name): string`
  * `v4(): string`
  * `v5(string|UuidInterface $ns, string $name): string`

### Changed

* Use paragonie/random-lib instead of ircmaxell/random-lib. This is a
  non-breaking change.
* Use a high-strength generator by default, when using `RandomLibAdapter`. This
  is a non-breaking change.

### Deprecated

These will be removed in version ramsey/uuid version 4.0.0:

* `MtRandGenerator`, `OpenSslGenerator`, and `SodiumRandomGenerator` are
  deprecated in favor of using the default `RandomBytesGenerator`.

### Fixed

* Set `ext-json` as a required dependency in `composer.json`.
* Use `PHP_OS` instead of `php_uname()` when determining the system OS, for
  cases when `php_uname()` is disabled for security reasons.


## [3.8.0] - 2018-07-19

### Added

* Support discovery of MAC addresses on FreeBSD systems
* Use a polyfill to provide PHP ctype functions when running on systems where the
  ctype functions are not part of the PHP build
* Disallow a trailing newline character when validating UUIDs
* Annotate thrown exceptions for improved IDE hinting


## [3.7.3] - 2018-01-19

### Fixed

* Gracefully handle cases where `glob()` returns false when searching
  `/sys/class/net/*/address` files on Linux
* Fix off-by-one error in `DefaultTimeGenerator`

### Security

* Switch to `random_int()` from `mt_rand()` for better random numbers


## [3.7.2] - 2018-01-13

### Fixed

* Check sysfs on Linux to determine the node identifier; this provides a
  reliable way to identify the node on Docker images, etc.


## [3.7.1] - 2017-09-22

### Fixed

* Set the multicast bit for random nodes, according to RFC 4122, ยง4.5

### Security

* Use `random_bytes()` when generating random nodes


## [3.7.0] - 2017-08-04

### Added

* Add the following UUID version constants:
>>>>>>> 67f1e3165dd1a748e8288b061d312588d9bf3045
    * `Uuid::UUID_TYPE_TIME`
    * `Uuid::UUID_TYPE_IDENTIFIER`

## 3.0.0-beta1

_Released: 2015-08-31_

  * Improve GUID support to ensure that:
    * On little endian (LE) architectures, the byte order of the first three fields is LE.
    * On big endian (BE) architectures, it is the same as a GUID.
    * String representation is always the same.
  * Fix exception message for `DegradedNumberConverter::fromHex()`.
  * Add Scrutinizer configuration to run code-quality builds through Scrutinizer.
  * Auto-fix Scrutinizer issues.
  * Fix support URLs in composer.json to point to the correct GitHub repository.

## 3.0.0-alpha3

_Released: 2015-07-28_

  * Time generator improvements:
    * Enabled use of custom TimeGenerator implementations.
      * BREAK: Removed now unnecessary `timeConverter` and `timeProvider` properties, setters, and getters in both `FeatureSet` and `UuidFactory` as those are now exclusively used by the default `TimeGenerator`.
      * Added a `setTimeGenerator` method on `UuidFactory` to override the default time generator.
    * Add option to enable `PeclUuidTimeGenerator` via `FeatureSet`.

## 3.0.0-alpha2

_Released: 2015-07-28_

  * BREAK: Removed `PeclUuidFactory` in favor of using pecl-uuid with generators.
  * NEW: Refactored time-based (version 1) UUIDs into a `TimeGeneratorInterface` to allow for other sources to generate version 1 UUIDs in this library.
  * NEW: Added `PeclUuidTimeGenerator` and `PeclUuidRandomGenerator` for creating version 1 or version 4 UUIDs using the pecl-uuid extension.
  * NEW: Add `RandomBytesGenerator` for use with PHP 7. ramsey/uuid will default to use this generator when running on PHP 7.
  * `RandomLibAdapter` now defaults to a medium-strength generator with [ircmaxell/random-lib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib). This is configurable, so other generator strengths may be used.
  * Migrated to the Travis CI container-based infrastructure for builds.
  * Documentation updates and corrections.

## 3.0.0-alpha1

_Released: 2015-07-16_

  * BREAK: The root namespace for this package has changed from "Rhumsaa" to "Ramsey." In most cases, simply making this change in your applications is the only upgrade path you will need. Everything else should work as expected.
  * BREAK: The UUID [Doctrine field type](http://doctrine-dbal.readthedocs.org/en/latest/reference/types.html) has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-doctrine](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-doctrine).
  * BREAK: The `uuid` console application has been moved to [ramsey/uuid-console](https://github.com/ramsey/uuid-console).
  * BREAK: The `Uuid::VERSION` package version constant has been removed.
  * NEW: The `Uuid` class is no longer marked as `final`. Everything is now based around interfaces and factories, allowing you to use this package as a base to implement other kinds of UUIDs with different dependencies.
  * NEW: Through setting dependencies on `UuidFactory` and/or extending `FeatureSet`, you may override any package defaults, injecting your own dependencies.
  * NEW: For random number generation, in addition to `OpenSslGenerator` (used if `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()` is present) and the fallback `MtRandGenerator`, you may use the bundled `CombGenerator` for sequential UUIDs or the `RandomLibAdapter` if using [ircmaxell/random-lib](https://github.com/ircmaxell/RandomLib).
  * NEW: In addition to the default UUID generation, this library also supports GUID generation by configuring a `FeatureSet` to use GUIDs.
  * NEW: While the interface to create UUIDs hasn't changed, if using this package on a 32-bit system, you will now receive an object of type `DegradedUuid` (which extends `Uuid`, which implements `UuidInterface`).
  * NEW: All UUIDs are now [JsonSerializable](http://php.net/JsonSerializable).

  * `RandomLibAdapter` to allow use of [ircmaxell/random-lib]
* Support GUID generation by configuring a `FeatureSet` to use GUIDs
* Allow UUIDs to be serialized as JSON through `JsonSerializable`

### Changed

* Change root namespace from "Rhumsaa" to "Ramsey;" in most cases, simply
  making this change in your applications is the only upgrade path you will
  needโeverything else should work as expected
* No longer consider `Uuid` class as `final`; everything is now based around
  interfaces and factories, allowing you to use this package as a base to
  implement other kinds of UUIDs with different dependencies
* Return an object of type `DegradedUuid` on 32-bit systems to indicate that
  certain features are not available

### Removed

* Move UUID [Doctrine field type] to [ramsey/uuid-doctrine]
* Move `uuid` console application to [ramsey/uuid-console]
* Remove `Uuid::VERSION` package version constant


## [2.9.0] - 2016-03-22

### Security

* Drop the use of OpenSSL as a fallback and use [paragonie/random_compat] to
  support `RandomBytesGenerator` in versions of PHP earlier than 7.0;
  this addresses and fixes the [collision issue]


## [2.8.4] - 2015-12-17

### Added

* Add support for symfony/console v3 in the `uuid` CLI application


## [2.8.3] - 2015-08-31

## [2.8.2] - 2015-07-23

### Fixed

* Ensure the release tag makes it into the rhumsaa/uuid package


## [2.8.1] - 2015-06-16

### Fixed

* Use `passthru()` and output buffering in `getIfconfig()`
* Cache the system node in a static variable so that we process it only once per
  runtime


## [2.8.0] - 2014-11-09

### Added

* Add static `fromInteger()` method to create UUIDs from string integer or
  `Moontoast\Math\BigNumber`

### Fixed

* Improve Doctrine conversion to Uuid or string for the ramsey/uuid [Doctrine
  field type]


## [2.7.4] - 2014-10-29

### Fixed

* Change loop in `generateBytes()` from `foreach` to `for`


## [2.7.3] - 2014-08-27

### Fixed

* Fix upper range for `mt_rand` used in version 4 UUIDs


## [2.7.2] - 2014-07-28

### Changed

* Upgrade to PSR-4 autoloading


## [2.7.1] - 2014-02-19

### Fixed

* Move moontoast/math and symfony/console to require-dev
* Support symfony/console 2.3 (LTS version)


## [2.7.0] - 2014-01-31

### Added

* Add `Uuid::VALID_PATTERN` constant containing a UUID validation regex pattern


## [2.6.1] - 2014-01-27

### Fixed

* Fix bug where `uuid` console application could not find the Composer
  autoloader when installed in another project


## [2.6.0] - 2014-01-17

### Added

* Introduce `uuid` console application for generating and decoding UUIDs from
  CLI (run `./bin/uuid` for details)
* Add `Uuid::getInteger()` to retrieve a `Moontoast\Math\BigNumber`
  representation of the 128-bit integer representing the UUID
* Add `Uuid::getHex()` to retrieve the hexadecimal representation of the UUID
* Use `netstat` on Linux to capture the node for a version 1 UUID
* Require moontoast/math as part of the regular package requirements


## [2.5.0] - 2013-10-30

### Added

* Use `openssl_random_pseudo_bytes()`, if available, to generate random bytes


## [2.4.0] - 2013-07-29

### Added

* Return `null` from `Uuid::getVersion()` if the UUID isn't an RFC 4122 variant
* Support string UUIDs without dashes passed to `Uuid::fromString()`


## [2.3.0] - 2013-07-16

### Added

* Support creation of UUIDs from bytes with `Uuid::fromBytes()`


## [2.2.0] - 2013-07-04

### Added

* Add `Doctrine\UuidType::requiresSQLCommentHint()` method


## [2.1.2] - 2013-07-03

### Fixed

* Fix cases where the system node was coming back with uppercase hexadecimal
  digits; this ensures that case in the node is converted to lowercase


## [2.1.1] - 2013-04-29

### Fixed

* Fix bug in `Uuid::isValid()` where the NIL UUID was not reported as valid


## [2.1.0] - 2013-04-15

### Added

* Allow checking the validity of a UUID through the `Uuid::isValid()` method


## [2.0.0] - 2013-02-11

### Added

* Support UUID generation on 32-bit platforms

### Changed

* Mark `Uuid` class `final`
* Require moontoast/math on 64-bit platforms for
  `Uuid::getLeastSignificantBits()` and `Uuid::getMostSignificantBits()`; the
  integers returned by these methods are *unsigned* 64-bit integers and
  unsupported even on 64-bit builds of PHP
* Move `UnsupportedOperationException` to the `Exception` subnamespace


## [1.1.2] - 2012-11-29

### Fixed

* Relax [Doctrine field type] conversion rules for UUIDs


## [1.1.1] - 2012-08-27

### Fixed

* Remove `final` keyword from `Uuid` class


## [1.1.0] - 2012-08-06

### Added

* Support ramsey/uuid UUIDs as a Doctrine Database Abstraction Layer (DBAL)
  field mapping type


## [1.0.0] - 2012-07-19

### Added

* Support generation of version 1, 3, 4, and 5 UUIDs
